1. Material SelectionGantry Mounting Plate: 6061-T6 Aluminum is the best choice for this part. It needs to be strong and rigid to support the weight of the entire print head without flexing. A thickness of 0.250? (6.35mm) should be sufficient.Heater Block: 6061-T6 Aluminum is the best choice. Its superior thermal conductivity is critical for distributing heat evenly. We will make this part from the maximum 0.500? (12.7mm) thick plate available.Water Block (Merged Top Plate): 5052 Aluminum is ideal due to its corrosion resistance. This will be a single, complex part made from 0.500? (12.7mm) plate, with water channels on the bottom and tapped holes on top.Water Block (Bottom Plate): 5052 Aluminum is also the choice here. We can use a thinner, standard 0.250? (6.35mm) plate for this part.2. Design for Milling (DFM)Internal Corners: The water channels in the two water block halves will have rounded internal corners due to the milling process. This is perfectly acceptable for water flow.Hole Tapping: You will need to specify the threads for each hole when ordering:Gantry Mounting Plate: M3 tapped holes for attaching the heater block.Heater Block: M6 threads for nozzles (bottom) and heat breaks (top), M3 for the thermistor grub screw, and M3 clearance holes for mounting to the gantry plate.Merged Top Water Block Plate: M3 clearance holes with counterbores for the assembly bolts, and M6 threads for the Bowden couplers.Bottom Water Block Plate: M3 threads for the assembly bolts, and G1/4" threads for the water inlet/outlet ports.Gasket: A custom-cut gasket from a sheet of high-temperature silicone (0.5mm thick) will be required to seal the two halves of the water block.
